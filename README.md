# Pima-Indians-Diabetes

Machine Learning algorithms are well known in the medical field for predicting diseases. This study was conducted using three different ML algorithms including Logistic  regression, Decision Tree, and the Na√Øve Bayes to predict if a particular observation is at a risk of developing diabetes. Moreover, K-means clustering and data mining is used to discover the grouping structures inherent in data. 

# The following steps was performed on the dataset:

1. Data Preparation
2. Predictive Modeling/Classification:
  a. Classification using Decision Tree
  b. Classification using Naive Bayes
  c. Classification using Logistic Regression
  d. Comparing the results of the 3 techniques
3. Post-prediction Analysis
  a. Applying cluster analysis and association rule mining on the results of the classification to provide customized   recommendations to the organization for its customers.
4. Conclusions and Recommendations
